\title{Rename Devices in Address Paths}
\usage{
rename_path_devices(path_data, device_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_data}{A data.frame from \code{get_address_paths()} containing path information.}

\item{device_names}{A named list or vector where names are old device IDs and values are new names.
Example: \code{c("14" = "Entrance", "18" = "Main Hall", "21" = "Exit")}}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the same structure as \code{path_data} but with renamed devices in the path column.
}
\description{
Replaces device identifiers in path strings with custom names.
Useful for converting numeric device IDs to meaningful location names.
}
\details{
The function processes all columns that might contain device identifiers:
\itemize{
\item \code{path}: The main path string (e.g., "14 -> 18 -> 21")
\item \code{first_device}: Starting device
\item \code{last_device}: Ending device
\item Device-specific columns if present
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get address paths
paths <- get_address_paths(files, top_n = 50)

# Define device names
names <- c("14" = "Entrance", "18" = "Main Hall", "21" = "Gallery", "16" = "Exit")

# Rename devices
paths_named <- rename_path_devices(paths, names)

# Now paths show: "Entrance -> Main Hall -> Gallery"
plot_address_paths_sankey(paths_named)
}
}
