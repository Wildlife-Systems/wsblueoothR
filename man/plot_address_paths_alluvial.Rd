\title{Visualize Address Paths as Alluvial Diagram}
\usage{
plot_address_paths_alluvial(
  path_data,
  min_flow = 1,
  max_steps = 10,
  fill_by = "device",
  alpha = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_data}{A data.frame from \code{get_address_paths()} containing a 'path' column.}

\item{min_flow}{Minimum number of addresses required for a flow to be displayed. Default is 1.}

\item{max_steps}{Maximum number of path steps to display. Paths longer than this will be truncated. Default is 10.}

\item{fill_by}{How to color the flows. Options: "device" (color by starting device),
"step" (color by position in path). Default is "device".}

\item{alpha}{Transparency of the flows (0-1). Default is 0.7.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the alluvial diagram.
}
\description{
Creates an alluvial (stream) diagram showing address flows through devices over time.
Alternative to Sankey diagram using ggplot2 and ggalluvial.
}
\details{
The alluvial diagram shows the flow of addresses through sequential device detections.
Each vertical axis represents a step in the path, and flows show address movements.

Requires the \code{ggalluvial} package. Install with: \code{install.packages("ggalluvial")}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
paths <- get_address_paths(files, top_n = 30)
plot_address_paths_alluvial(paths, min_flow = 2)
}
