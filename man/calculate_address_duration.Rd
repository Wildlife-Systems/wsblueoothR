\title{Calculate Address Duration per Device and Day}
\usage{
calculate_address_duration(
  input_files,
  progress_interval = 10000L,
  device_filter = characterVector(),
  min_date = "",
  max_date = "",
  include_list = characterVector(),
  exclude_list = characterVector(),
  low_memory = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_files}{Character vector of file paths to process.}

\item{progress_interval}{Integer. How often to print progress (0 = no progress). Default is 10000.}

\item{low_memory}{Logical. If TRUE, processes one device at a time to reduce memory usage. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{device}{Device ID}
\item{date}{Date in YYYY-MM-DD format}
\item{address}{Bluetooth MAC address}
\item{first_seen}{Timestamp of first detection (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)}
\item{last_seen}{Timestamp of last detection (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)}
\item{duration_seconds}{Time duration in seconds between first and last detection}
\item{detection_count}{Number of times this address was detected}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the time duration (in seconds) that each Bluetooth address
was detected by each device on each day. The duration is calculated as
the time difference between the first and last detection of that address
on that device on that day.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
durations <- calculate_address_duration("data/combined_sort.txt")
# Multiple files
durations <- calculate_address_duration(c("file1.txt", "file2.txt"))
