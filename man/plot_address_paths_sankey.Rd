\usage{
plot_address_paths_sankey(
  path_data,
  min_flow = 1,
  title = "Address Movement Through Devices",
  node_color = NULL,
  link_color = "source",
  font_size = 12,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_data}{A data.frame from \code{get_address_paths()} containing a 'path' column.}

\item{min_flow}{Minimum number of addresses required for a flow to be displayed. Default is 1.}

\item{title}{Plot title. Default is "Address Movement Through Devices".}

\item{node_color}{Color scheme for nodes. Can be a single color or vector of colors.}

\item{link_color}{Color scheme for links. Options: "source" (color by source node),
"target" (color by target node), or a specific color value. Default is "source".}

\item{font_size}{Font size for node labels. Default is 12.}

\item{node_width}{Width of the nodes in pixels. Default is 15.}

\item{node_padding}{Vertical padding between nodes in pixels. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A networkD3 Sankey diagram object (can be printed to display).
}
\description{
Creates an interactive Sankey diagram showing the flow of addresses through devices.
Each path segment (device A -> device B) becomes a flow in the diagram, with width
proportional to the number of addresses following that route.
}
\details{
The function parses path strings (e.g., "16 -> 18 -> 21") and creates a Sankey
diagram where:
\itemize{
\item Nodes represent devices
\item Links represent address movements between devices
\item Link width shows the number of addresses following that path segment
}

Requires the \code{networkD3} package. Install with: \code{install.packages("networkD3")}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get address paths
paths <- get_address_paths(files, top_n = 50)

# Create Sankey diagram
plot_address_paths_sankey(paths)

# Only show flows with at least 3 addresses
plot_address_paths_sankey(paths, min_flow = 3)

# Customize appearance
plot_address_paths_sankey(paths,
                         title = "Device Movement Patterns",
                         node_color = "steelblue",
                         link_color = "target")
}
}
