\title{Get Unique Device Names from Bluetooth Data File or Result}
\usage{
get_device_names(input, progress_interval = 10000, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character string or bluetooth_data object. Either:
\itemize{
\item Path to input data file with format: device datetime address power name
\item Result object from process_bluetooth()
}}

\item{progress_interval}{Integer. Report progress every N lines (must be positive).
Default is 10000. Only used when reading from a file.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), print processing messages to console.
Set to FALSE to suppress output.}
}
\value{
A character vector of unique device names found in the data, sorted alphabetically.
Empty names are included as empty strings.
}
\description{
Extracts unique device names either from a Bluetooth data file or from
the result of process_bluetooth(). When called after process_bluetooth(),
it uses the device names that were already collected during processing,
avoiding a second pass through the file.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Method 1: Get names directly from file (requires reading entire file)
names <- get_device_names("data/combined_sort.txt")

# Method 2: Get names from process_bluetooth result (no extra file read)
data <- process_bluetooth("data/combined_sort.txt")
names <- get_device_names(data)

# See what names are present
head(names)
}
