\usage{
get_address_paths(
  files,
  top_n = 10,
  progress_interval = 10000,
  verbose = TRUE,
  devices = NULL,
  min_date = NULL,
  max_date = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{Character vector of file paths to process. Can be a single file or multiple files.}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Number of top addresses to return (by detection count). Default is 10.}

\item{progress_interval}{Integer. How often to print progress messages (0 = no progress). Default is 10000.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print progress messages. Default is TRUE.}

\item{devices}{Character vector. Filter by specific device IDs. NULL = all devices. Default is NULL.}

\item{min_date}{Character or Date. Minimum date to include (YYYY-MM-DD or Date object). NULL = no minimum. Default is NULL.}

\item{max_date}{Character or Date. Maximum date to include (YYYY-MM-DD or Date object). NULL = no maximum. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{address}{Bluetooth MAC address}
\item{detection_count}{Total number of detections}
\item{device_count}{Number of unique devices that detected this address}
\item{first_seen}{First detection timestamp (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)}
\item{last_seen}{Last detection timestamp (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)}
\item{path}{Chronological path through devices (e.g., "16 -> 18 -> 16 -> 21")}
}
}
\description{
For each address, creates a chronological path showing which devices detected
the address over time. Returns the top N addresses by detection count, showing
how they moved between devices.
}
\details{
This function tracks how addresses move through the sensor network over time.
The path shows device transitions - consecutive detections on the same device
are collapsed into a single entry in the path.

For example, if an address is detected on device 16 (100 times), then device 18
(50 times), then back to device 16 (75 times), the path will be "16 -> 18 -> 16".

The function returns the top N addresses by total detection count, which helps
identify the most frequently detected devices and their movement patterns.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get top 10 addresses
paths <- get_address_paths("data/combined_sort.txt")

# Get top 50 addresses
paths <- get_address_paths("data.txt", top_n = 50)

# Filter by devices
paths <- get_address_paths("data.txt", devices = c("16", "18", "21"), top_n = 20)

# Filter by date range
paths <- get_address_paths("data.txt",
